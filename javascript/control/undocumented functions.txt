Sometimes the objects returned by the plotting functions have extra 
methods attached to them. I couldn't figure out how to add them to 
the documentation so I'm listing them here.


bode:
The array returned by bode has a method 'update(System sys)'
which changes the bode plot to use sys.

pzmap:
Same as bode.

rlocus:
If rlocus was created with interactive===true then the
plot returned has an extra method 'set_k(Number k)'.
This changes the positions of the red circles to
the position of the roots for k.

step:
The plot has an extra method called 'show_step_info(Object options)'.
The options object contains booleans corresponding to which of the
stepinfo components should be displayed on the plot.
show_step_info(true) or show_step_info(false) respectively enable/disable
all components.
These are the properties for the components:
    - settled: A dashed line for the value at which the simulation has settled.
    - peak: Mark the peak of the step response.
    - settle_time: Mark the point from which the step response is considered "settled".
    - rise_time: Mark the beginning and end of the rise time window.
    - rise_time_text: Draw in text how big the rise time window is.
example:
    - show_step_info({settled: true, peak: true}) only renders the peak and the final value.
    - show_step_info({settled: false}) disables the final value. Only the peak is
      rendered from now on.
