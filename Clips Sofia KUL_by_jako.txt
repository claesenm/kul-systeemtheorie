These are the clips that helped me a lot for the study of this course. 
I found that a lot of clips that I was thinking about are already included in the online platform. 
These are not included yet. 

They are all from an online teacher called Brian Douglas

1) Step-by-step explanation regarind Gain and Phase Margin (with visual insight)

2) Step-by-step explanation of the sensitivity function + an extra insight that is not included in the course text

3) 2 short clips explaining PID-controllers. The first one is a decent introduction, and the second one uses 
2 cars as metaphors for why you should use P, I, or D control. (There is already a similar clip added, but maybe this one gives extra insight?)

4) This clip helped me a lot. It gives a more graphical approach of the laplace transform and the frequency spectrum.
